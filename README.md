# Classifying-Drugs-a-supervised-ML

Problem Statement
The increasing complexity of the drug landscape has made it difficult to classify drugs accurately, leading to confusion and potential risks for patients.

This has a direct impact on patient safety, as the improper use of medications can lead to adverse events. Furthermore, the lack of unified drug classification makes prescribing, dispensing, and monitoring of drug therapies difficult for healthcare professionals.

As such, it is essential to develop a comprehensive drug classification system that is both accurate and standardized. Such a system should include age, gender, BP levels, Cholesterol levels, Sodium to potassium ratio to ensure that healthcare professionals are accurately prescribing and monitoring medications.

Additionally, such a system should be tailored to the specific needs of the patient and should be easily accessible to both healthcare professionals and patients.


Scenario (Hypothetical):
The government has recently put into place a new drug classification system. Drugs are now classified into five categories based on the potential risk they pose to public health and safety.

Category 1 drugs are considered to be the most dangerous, and can only be prescribed by a physician under strict supervision. These drugs are highly regulated and require a prescription from a certified physician.

Category 2 drugs have a moderate risk and can be prescribed by a physician with some restrictions.

Category 3 drugs have a low risk and can be sold over the counter without a prescription.

Category 4 drugs are considered to be safe and can be sold without any restrictions.

Category 5 drugs are considered to be generally safe but may have some potential risks associated with them. They can be sold without a prescription but with certain restrictions.
